# things to get done for the app:
- Add actual date system for calculations (more realistic)
- Add possibility of creating and saving scenarios for easier comparisons.
    - Add scenario names
- Add explanations to different fields to better explain what they actually mean
- Prettify the app (Have a more proper UI structure, choose fitting colors, perhaps even a nice logo or images of some kind)
- Add some standard inputs with regard to normal norwegian laws so entering information about investments goes faster.
- Add a type for a general asset (no preinput of information)
- Add a visualization to differentiate between principal and rate payments for loans
- Disallow the addition of loans if the monthly income is lower than the monthly cost
- Add option to divide remaining monthly income between several different stocks/assets
- Add option of different compound/interest accrual frequencies (daily, monthly, etc)
- Add option for adding large single-time purchases (cars for example) and whether these use stock sales to gather the money
- Display amount of money that is invested in stocks/assets
- Add wealth tax calculation
- Add correct calculations for interest when loans are deferred. Currently this is added to the principal, but this is not correct.
- Set a fixed size for the graph tooltip
