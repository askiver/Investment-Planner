# things to get done for the app:
- Add possibility of selecting start date for investments and expenditures
- Add possibility of selecting part of asset value to be sold and used as loan deductible.
- Add possibility of creating and saving scenarios for easier comparisons.
    - Add scenario names
- Add explanations to different fields to better explain what they actually mean
- Prettify the app (Have a more proper UI structure, choose fitting colors, perhaps even a nice logo or images of some kind)
- Add some standard inputs with regard to normal norwegian laws so entering information about investments goes faster.
- Display information regarding principal rate payments for loans more clearly (Perhaps in the graph tooltip?)
- Add a type for a general asset (no preinput of information)
- Add a visualization to differentiate between principal and rate payments for loans
- Add a year parameter to timeline so it gets more managable to use
- Disallow the addition of loans if the monthly income is lower than the monthly cost
- Add option to divide remaining monthly income between several different stocks/assets
